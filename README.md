I do internet wizardry on many layers, and this can range from simple java script to data retrieval and complete forensical inspection of digital devices, or hunting criminals for fun. Hacking is not an ability exclusive to criminals who live in the so called darknet leaking data from institutions they breached according to media outlets and ordinary folks, or some random twitter user claiming to own people and terminate them on social, in fact they are not even hackers as they do not deserve this title for their abjective ends. I also do not apply this title to me although the knowledge I have gathered and use for ethical and safety purposes, both for me or anyone close to me, and most of my knowledge was by just browsing the web in a standard google chrome browser rather than actually engaging in courses for knowledge craft about the digital world, I still not consider my self as a hacker, because this title has a more profound meaning and shall be reserved only for the ones who actually deserves it.
