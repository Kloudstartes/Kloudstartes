Joshua "ScorchedDATA" Stepherson<br>

I do internet wizardry on many layers, and this can range from simple java script to data retrieval and complete forensical inspection of digital devices, or tracking entire incels or gang stalker groups, and maybe putting them in the court for fun. Hacking is not an ability exclusive to criminals who live in the so called darknet leaking data from institutions they breached according to media outlets and ordinary folks, or some random twitter user claiming to own people and terminate them on social media, in fact they are not even hackers as they do not deserve this title for their abjective ends. Not even I call my self a hacker even though I am heavily influenced by this community, but I can do hacking if necessary and for good when necessary. Growing with computers surrounding me everywhere, understanding them and coding was an inevitable fate. I see hacking as a funny thing, and while for most it is a serious area to engage, for me it is just a sport.
